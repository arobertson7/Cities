*** Tracing function calls ***

playGame() is the over-arching function that starts the game once the start button is pressed

Right now, it calls...

1. setupCitiesQueue() which ends calling no other functions or creating any event listeners.

2. setupGameDisplay() which only needs to happen once at the beginning, it calls ----

----> displayQuestion() which ends calling no other function, but it creates a button "click" event listener to ------

------> evaluateAnswer() which has 2 routes: if it's not the last round, it ends calling no other function but creates button "click" event to --------

--------> nextRound() which calls both displayQuestion() (which will loop on button clicks as seen above) and setupNewRound() which ends, not calling anything or creating any event listeners.

3. setupNewRound() which ends, not calling anything or creating any event listeners. Has to happen this first time to setup the first round.
